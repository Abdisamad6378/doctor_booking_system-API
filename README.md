# doctor_booking_system-API

Using RESTful endpoints, this API offers full appointment scheduling functionality. In addition to creating accounts and managing their profiles, patients can schedule appointments, check real-time availability, browse doctors by specialty, and view or cancel previous reservations. Doctors' specializations, credentials and availability schedules can all be added. The appointment system manages booking confirmations, creates one-of-a-kind appointment numbers, keeps track of all bookings, and uses database constraints to avoid double bookings. JWT authentication is used to securely store all data, safeguarding user information.
